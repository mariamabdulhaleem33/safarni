## 🟢 My Contribution (Frontend Focus)

I worked as a **Frontend Developer**, focusing mainly on the **Password Recovery Flow**, which includes **three screens**:

- ✅ **Forgot Password** – Users can enter their registered email to request a password reset  
- ✅ **OTP Verification** – Users receive a One-Time Password (OTP) to verify their identity  
- ✅ **Reset Password** – Users can set a new password
- ✅ Implemented form validation and input feedback using **React Hook Form** and **Zod**  
- ✅ Used **shadcn/ui** components for consistent styling  
- ✅ Managed asynchronous state and API interactions using **TanStack Query**  
- ✅ Designed responsive and user-friendly UI for all screens
